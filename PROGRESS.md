# Progress

Status of the Rust port. Update this file with every merged change.

## Done
- Workspace scaffold and shared interfaces (`pz-kahlua` values/tables/native
  call contract, `pz-fs`, `pz-render` draw list, `pz-text`, `pz-ui`).
- Kahlua tables: insertion order, metatable-aware `rawget`, `#` length.
- Kahlua number formatting/parsing (Java `Double.toString`/`parseDouble`).

- Kahlua compiler: all 1,395 Lua files shipped with Build 42.21 compile to
  bytecode byte-identical to the original compiler (checked locally with
  `examples/compare_bytecode.rs` against the original's `Prototype.dump`).
- Kahlua VM (KahluaThread loop, metatables, errors, coroutines) and
  BaseLib, TableLib, MathLib, CoroutineLib, RandomLib.

- World/maps (`pz-world`): lot headers, lotpacks, `MapFiles`, meta grid
  rooms/buildings, `.tiles` reader, `Fix2x`, and chunk loading through
  `IsoCell.PlaceLot`/`CellLoader.LoadCellBinaryChunk`. Object creation
  (`CellLoader.DoTileObjectCreation`: doors, windows, curtains, light
  switches, trees, stoves, radios/TVs, ...), `FixStackableObjects`,
  associated buildings and adjacent-cell rooms match the original per
  square, field and `Rand` draw on 10,240 Muldraugh chunks, checked locally.
  Header and lotpack decoding match the original loader on 163
  cells (Muldraugh sample plus six challenge maps), checked locally.
  Tile definitions (`pz_world::sprite`): `IsoSpriteManager`,
  `PropertyContainer`, `TilePropertyAliasMap` and the full
  `IsoWorld.LoadTileDefinitions` property pass; all 61,229 sprites match the
  original loader locally. Enum and lookup tables are runtime data
  (`SpriteTables`, `ObjectTables`); the jar loader awaits `pz-classfile`.
- Chunk save files (`pz_world::save`): `map/<wx>/<wy>.bin` load and save
  (`IsoChunk`, `IsoGridSquare`, `IsoObject` and the object classes chunks
  hold, corpses, containers, mod data, erosion data). Items and ECS
  components are kept as their length-framed bytes. On 14,894 real chunk
  files the decoded squares match the original's load except for one
  constructor-added component class, and 13,348 re-saves are byte-identical
  to the original's own re-save (the rest differ inside item or component
  records, which the original re-saves through classes not ported here);
  4,085 map-loaded chunks saved here load and re-save as expected in the
  original. Checked locally.
- StringLib and OsLib. Local differential run against the original Kahlua
  (`examples/differential.rs`): 64 of 65 corpus scripts produce identical
  output; the remaining one differs only in an identity hash.

## In progress
- UIElement/UIManager, Core options, client window loop.

## Next (main-menu milestone)
1. Kahlua stdlib; load `stdlib.lbc`/`stdlib.lua` from the install.
2. `LuaManager.init` + `LoadDirBase("shared")`, `("client")` with API stubs.
3. Fonts, translations, textures, UIElement/UIManager.
4. `MainScreenState` running `MainScreen.lua` in the client.
